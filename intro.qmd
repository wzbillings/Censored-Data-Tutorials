# What are censored data?

Censoring is a selection phenomenon on data which occurs when we can only
obtain precise measurements for certain measurement values. The classical
example is a scale which can only measure weights up to a certain threshold,
say $y_{\mathrm{max}}$. A scale that can measure any weight would produce the
set of measurements $\{y_1^*, y_2^*, \ldots, y_n^*\}$ where $n$ is the sample
size. We call these the **latent values** or **true values**. Our imperfect
scale would then produce the **observed values**,
$$
y_i = \begin{cases}
y_i^*, & y_i^* \leq y_{\mathrm{max}} \\
y_{\mathrm{max}}, & y_i^* > y_{\mathrm{max}}
\end{cases}; \quad i = 1, \ldots, n.
$$
Specifically, this is an example of **right censoring**, where there is an
**upper limit of detection**, or maximum value that we can observe with
precision.

We can also have the opposite case, where we can detect any theoretical
measurement above a certain value. In this case, the data are said to have a
**lower limit of detection** and this phenomenon is called **left censoring**.
For example, imagine we are testing the concentration of lead in the tap water
of several buildings. Our test cannot detect lead levels below 5 parts per
billion (ppb), but can detect any larger amount of lead. In that case, our
observed values would instead look like this:
$$
y_i = \begin{cases}
y_i^*, & y_i^* \geq y_{\mathrm{min}} \\
y_{\mathrm{min}}, & y_i^* < y_{\mathrm{min}}
\end{cases}; \quad i = 1, \ldots, n,
$$
where $y_{\mathrm{min}}$ is the lower limit of detection.

$$
y_i = \begin{cases}
y_i^*, & y_i^* \geq y_{\mathrm{min}} \\
y_{\mathrm{min}}, & y_i^* < y_{\mathrm{min}}
\end{cases}; \quad i = 1, \ldots, n,
$$

Finally, we can have interval censoring, where we know a data value is within
some interval, but we do not know precisely where the value lies within that
interval. An example of this is antibody titer dilutions: for flu HAI titer,
the values are typically reported as 10, 20, 40, etc., but a value of 10 does
not mean the precise value of the measurement should be 10, it means the true
value is between 10 and 20. If we assume our titer is measured on the log
scale and has no limits of detection, we could write
$$
y_i = \lfloor y_i^* \rfloor; \quad i = 1, \ldots, n,
$$
because we only perform a discrete number of dilutions. This gives us the
interval value for $y_i$ as
$$y_i \in \left[\lfloor y_i^* \rfloor, \lfloor y_i^* + 1 \rfloor\right).$$

We can also have values which are subject to both a lower and an upper
limit of detection.
