    "section": "",
    "text": "Censoring is a selection phenomenon on data which occurs when we can only obtain precise measurements for certain measurement values. The classical example is a scale which can only measure weights up to a certain threshold, say \\(y_{\\mathrm{max}}\\). A scale that can measure any weight would produce the set of measurements \\(\\{y_1^*, y_2^*, \\ldots, y_n^*\\}\\) where \\(n\\) is the sample size. We call these the latent values or true values. Our imperfect scale would then produce the observed values, \\[\ny_i = \\begin{cases}\ny_i^*, & y_i^* \\leq y_{\\mathrm{max}} \\\\\ny_{\\mathrm{max}}, & y_i^* &gt; y_{\\mathrm{max}}\n\\end{cases}; \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, n.\n\\] Specifically, this is an example of right censoring, where there is an upper limit of detection, or maximum value that we can observe with precision. Right censoring is also incredibly common in epidemiology and biomedical studies: when we conduct an observational study or clinical trial, we expect to observe individuals who have not experienced the outcome of interest before the trial ends. These individuals have a time-to-event with a lower bound of the length of the trial (the event could have occurred the moment we stopped observing) and an infinite upper bound, because the event may never occur. Such an individual’s survival time would be right-censored, and many common survival analysis methods can account for right-censored data (assuming an appropriate parametric distribution for the outcome).\nWe can also have the opposite case, where we can detect any theoretical measurement above a certain value. In this case, the data are said to have a lower limit of detection and this phenomenon is called left censoring. For example, imagine we are testing the concentration of lead in the tap water of several buildings. Our test cannot detect lead levels below 1 part per billion (ppb), but can detect any larger amount of lead. In that case, our observed values would instead look like this: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i &= \\begin{cases}\ny_i^*, & y_i^* \\geq y_{\\mathrm{min}} \\\\\ny_{\\mathrm{min}}, & y_i^* &lt; y_{\\mathrm{min}}\n\\end{cases};\\\\\ni &= 1, \\ldots, n; \\\\\ny_{\\min} &= 1 \\text{ ppb;}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(y_{\\mathrm{min}}\\) is the lower limit of detection. I don’t know anything about how lead concentration tests work, but suppose that at a certain point our test “saturates”: we know that the concentration is at or above, say, 5 parts per million (ppm), but the test cannot detect any higher values. Then some of our observations would be left-censored (below the lower LOD) and some observations would be right-censored (above the upper LOD). So then the lead level data that we observe would look this:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i &= \\begin{cases}\ny_{\\mathrm{min}}, & y_i^* &lt; y_{\\mathrm{min}} \\\\\ny_i^*, & y_{\\max} \\geq y_i^* \\geq y_{\\mathrm{min}} \\\\\ny_{\\max}, & y_i^* &gt; y_{\\max}\n\\end{cases};\\\\\ni &= 1, \\ldots, n; \\\\\ny_{\\min} &= 1 \\text{ ppb;} \\\\\ny_{\\max} &= 5 \\text{ ppm;}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Note that for a continuous random variable like (presumably) the level of lead in drinking water, it doesn’t really matter which categories include the boundary values, because \\(P(Y_i^* = y_i^*) = 0\\) for any value of \\(y_i^*\\) including \\(y_{\\min}\\) and \\(y_{\\max}\\). If the censored variable is not absolutely continuous, then this distinction may need to be clarified and depends on the observation process.\nFinally, we can have interval censoring, where we know a data value is within some interval, but we do not know precisely where the value lies within that interval. We could imagine a lead test that looks like this (whether such a test could exist in reality, I am unsure). Suppose that the test involves dipping a test strip into water, and the test strip changes color based on the amount of lead present in the water. However, only a discrete number of shades can be visibility distinguished, so even though the underlying variable of interest is continuous (again, the lead concentration), we only observe a discrete set of outcomes. For example, if our outcome can only reliably discern 6 different concentrations, the data might look like this. The table below also includes a coding scheme in the “Data Value” column showing how we might write down the data.\n\ncolfunc &lt;- colorRampPalette(c(\"white\", \"firebrick3\"))\nconc &lt;- c(\"&lt;1 ppb\", \"1 ppb - 10 ppb\", \"10 ppb - 100 ppb\", \"100 ppb - 1000 ppb\",\n                    \"1000 ppb - 5000 ppb\", \"&gt;5000 ppb\")\nvalues &lt;- c(0, 5, 50, 500, 2500, 5000)\ntable_data &lt;-\n    tibble::tibble(\n        \"Lead Concentration\" = conc,\n        \"Strip Color\" = 1:length(conc),\n        \"Data Value\" = values\n    )\nlead_table &lt;-\n    table_data |&gt;\n    gt::gt() |&gt;\n    gt::data_color(\n        columns = c(`Strip Color`),\n        palette = colfunc(length(conc))\n    ) |&gt;\n    gt::tab_style(\n        style = gt::cell_text(color = \"#00000000\"),\n        locations = gt::cells_body(columns = `Strip Color`)\n    )\n\nlead_table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLead Concentration\nStrip Color\nData Value\n\n\n\n\n&lt;1 ppb\n1\n0\n\n\n1 ppb - 10 ppb\n2\n5\n\n\n10 ppb - 100 ppb\n3\n50\n\n\n100 ppb - 1000 ppb\n4\n500\n\n\n1000 ppb - 5000 ppb\n5\n2500\n\n\n&gt;5000 ppb\n6\n5000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general there is not a unique or standardized way to write down interval censored data, and writing down the data model will heavily depend on the observation process and the coding scheme for the values. For this specific example, we could write down the observation model like this:\n\\[\ny_i = \\begin{cases}\n0, & 1 &gt; y_i^* \\\\\n5, & 10 &gt; y_i^* \\geq 1 \\\\\n50, & 100 &gt; y_i^* \\geq 10 \\\\\n500, & 1000 &gt; y_i^* \\geq 100 \\\\\n2500, & 5000 &gt; y_i^* \\geq 1000 \\\\\n5000, & y_i^* \\geq 5000\n\\end{cases}; \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, n.\n\\] It is possible to write the math model in a more compact form as well — we will discuss this further in a detailed section on interval censoring.\nAnother example of this is influenza HAI titer, which we will dedicate an entire case study to later on. Briefly, the values are typically reported as 10, 20, 40, etc., but a value of 10 does not mean the precise value of the measurement should be 10, it means the true value is between 10 and 20. If we assume our titer is measured on the log scale and has no limits of detection, we could write \\[\ny_i = \\lfloor y_i^* \\rfloor; \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, n,\n\\] because we only perform a discrete number of dilutions. This gives us the interval value for \\(y_i\\) as \\[y_i \\in \\left[\\lfloor y_i^* \\rfloor, \\lfloor y_i^* + 1 \\rfloor\\right).\\]\nA given variable can be subject to all of these types of censoring simultaneously: for example, HAI titers are interval censored in this way, but they also have lower limits of detection and upper limits of detection as well (though the upper limits are rarely important in practice because they can be arbitrarily increased during the assay). However, a particular observation of this variable can only be subject to one type of censoring at a time: e.g., if an observation is below the detection limit, that value is left censored, it cannot simultaneously be right censored or interval censored.\nNotably, the distinction between “types” of censoring in this way is useful for several analytic methods, but is not strictly necessary. All censored values can be implicitly treated as interval censored data, where the lower endpoint for a left censored value is negative infinity, and the upper endpoint for a right censored value is positive infinity. Thus, we could write the data generating process for HAI titers with LOD as \\[\ny_i = \\begin{cases}\ny_{l}, & \\ y_i^* &lt; y_{\\text{min}}\\\\\n\\lfloor y_i^* \\rfloor, &\\ y_{\\text{min}} \\leq y_i^* &lt; y_{\\text{max}} \\\\\ny_{i}, & y_i^* \\leq y_{\\text{max}}\n\\end{cases},\n\\] where \\(y_{\\text{min}}\\) is the lower limit of detection and \\(y_{\\text{max}}\\) is the upper limit of detection. Here, \\(y_l \\leq y_{\\min}\\) and \\(y_u \\geq y_{\\max}\\) are arbitrary constants that can be the same as the limits of detection or not, so long as we know which censoring category the given \\(y_i\\) value falls into. We can write down the value for the censored values however we want as long as we know what interval the points fall into.\nTo express the DGP in interval notation, we would write \\[\ny_i \\in \\begin{cases}\n\\left(-\\infty, y_{l}\\right), & y_i^* &lt; y_{\\text{min}}\\\\\n\\left[\\lfloor y_i^* \\rfloor, \\lfloor y_i^* + 1 \\rfloor\\right), & y_{\\text{min}} \\leq y_i^* &lt; y_{\\text{max}} \\\\\n\\left[y_{u}, \\infty\\right), & y_i^* \\leq y_{\\text{max}}\n\\end{cases}.\n\\] Note also that assuming \\(y^*_i\\) is drawn from an absolutely continuous distribution (e.g. normal or lognormal, etc.), the final likelihood model will be equivalent regardless of which intervals are open or closed. This model would allow us to put all of the censored observations into the likelihood function in the same framework without having to worry about sorting the observations into buckets w.r.t. the type of censoring.\nThe probability of each observation \\(y_i\\) can then be expressed as the probability that the random variable \\(Y\\) takes on a realization inside the given interval. That is, if \\(y_i^*\\) is detectable (greater than the lower LoD, but less than the upper LoD), we would write \\[P(Y_i = y_i) = P\\left(\\lfloor y_i^* + 1 \\rfloor \\geq Y_i^* \\geq \\lfloor y_i^* \\rfloor \\right).\\] Recall that every random variable \\(Y\\) has a cumulative density function, or CDF, which is defined as \\[F_Y(y) = P(Y \\leq y).\\] Using the definitions of all these probability things, we can say (proof omitted) that \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(Y_i = y_i) &= P\\left(\\lfloor y_i^* + 1 \\rfloor \\geq Y_i^* \\geq \\lfloor y_i^* \\rfloor \\right) \\\\\n&= P(Y_i^* \\leq \\lfloor y_i^* + 1 \\rfloor) - P(Y_i \\leq \\lfloor y_i^* \\rfloor) \\\\\n&= F_Y(\\lfloor y_i^* + 1 \\rfloor) - F_Y(\\lfloor y_i^* \\rfloor).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] This applies to the nondetectable measurements as well, but we need to take the limit as \\(Y_i \\to \\pm \\infty\\).Fortunately, this is a defining property of the CDF as you can see on the linked wikipedia page. So we can write \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(Y_i = y_\\min) &= \\lim_{a \\to -\\infty}P\\left(y_{\\text{min}} \\geq Y_i^* \\geq a \\right) \\\\\n&= F(y_\\min) - \\lim_{a \\to -\\infty} F(a) \\\\\n&= F(y_\\min) - 0 = F(y_\\min).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Similarly, we get that \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(Y_i = y_\\max) &= \\lim_{b \\to \\infty}P\\left(b \\geq Y_i^* \\geq y_\\max \\right) \\\\\n&= \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} F(b) -  F(y_\\max) \\\\\n&= 1 - F(y_\\max).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAt first, it can be difficult to see how this probability calculations are useful for statistical data analysis. To fully make the connection, we will need to make use of an indicator variable, say \\(c_i\\), which is equal to 1 when the observation \\(y_i\\) is censored, and equal to 0 if \\(y_i\\) is not censored. To fit some parametric model with parameter vector \\(\\theta\\), we often turn to the likelihood function, which is \\[\n\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\theta \\mid y \\right) = f_Y(y \\mid \\theta)\n\\] if there are no censored values (here we implicitly assume that \\(y\\) is absolutely continuous). The function \\(f_Y(y \\mid \\theta)\\) is the probability density function of random variable \\(Y\\) where we consider the parameters to be fixed at the value \\(\\theta\\).\nIn constructing the likelihood for our observation \\(Y_i\\), we run into the slightly tricky business1 that \\(Y_i\\) is not always continuous – if the \\(i\\)th observation is censored, \\(Y_i\\) actually becomes discrete. We will not address the technicalities of combining censored and discrete data here, but suffice to say if the parametric model we assume for \\(Y_i\\) is any standard (all GLM compatible distributions and many others beyond), we can say that \\[\n\\mathcal{L}(\\theta \\mid y_i) = \\bigg( f(y_i \\mid \\theta) \\bigg)^{1 - c_i} \\bigg( P(Y_i = y_i)\\bigg)^{c_i}.\n\\] That is, we can use the continuous probability density \\(f\\) when \\(y_i\\) is not censored and the discrete probability of the realization \\(y_i\\) if the observation is censored.\nWe can then (assuming mutual, potentially conditional, independence of the observations) write the likelihood of the sample by multiplying together all of our individual \\(y_i\\) likelihoods. With the sample likelihood in hand, we can proceed to do whatever kinds of torture we would normally do in modern statistics, like finding parameter values that maximize the likelihood, or adding priors and using Bayes’ theorem.\nIn the following chapters, we’ll discuss a bit more theory but primarily go through some examples. Notably, we’ve only discussed univariate analyses here, so in the first example we’ll walk through an actual example of dealing with a censored outcome variable. Dealing with censored predictor/independent variables is much more detailed, and will be explained in its own example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto really get into the details of this, you need Lebesgue’s decomposition theorem which relies on measure theory. Writing out the likelihood in a more general form without the censoring indicators is also not possible without measure theory because it relies on the Radon-Nikodym theorem. If this is the part you want to learn about, you will have to learn it from someone other than me!↩︎",

    "section": "2.1 Glyphosate data simulation",
    "text": "2.1 Glyphosate data simulation\nIn this first example, since we’re trying to understand these models, we’ll simulate our data from a known generative model. This allows us to be confident that our model for censored data is actually helping us to recover the correct parameters. Once we’re more comfortable with the model, we can try to analyze some data with unknown generative processeses.\nGlyphosate is an organophosphonate pesticide originally marketed as Roundup by Monsanto. Roundup was quickly adopted for industrial agriculture, especially after the introduction of genetically modified Roundup-resistant crop species in the mid-90’s. Due to widespread agricultural use in the US, glyphosate is an increasingly common groundwater contaminant, with a Maximum Containment Level Goal of 0.7 parts per million in tap water set by the EPA.\n\nSource population. Our fictional source population will be \\(n\\) randomly sampled households from a fictional city, indexed from \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\). We only have one measurement per household. For the purposes of our study, we’ll assume that each of these houses has their own water supply (which is unrealistic but sufficient for a censored data tutorial).\nOutcome variable. For this example, our outcome (or dependent) variable is \\(y_i\\), the log concentration of glyphosate in parts per million (ppm) detected from the tap in household \\(i\\) using an analytical test.\nCensoring structure. Our investigators have decided to use the test described in this paper, which has a lower limit of detection of 2 µM. Given a molar mass of 169.07 g/Mol for glyphosate, we can convert this to an LoD of 0.33 ppm, just under half of the MCLG. We assume there is no upper LoD or interval censoring.\nIndependent variables. For the sake of this example, we will measure a few independent variables at the household level. Without doing any research on the actual patterns of glyphosate distribution in groundwater, we’ll assume that glyphosate concentration is affected by:\n\ndistance to the nearest agriculture site (km).\nwhether the home uses glyphosate-based pesticides for personal gardening.\nwhether the home has a water filter on the primary tap.\n\n\nTo get our data, we’ll first randomly generate our covariates. Let’s assume that our town of interest is a square, so we can normalize all of the distances so that each side of the square has length 1. Then (again somewhat unrealistically) we’ll assume that home X and Y coordinates are independently drawn from a uniform distribution on \\((0, 1)\\). For convenience, we’ll place the only farm in town at \\((0.5, 0.5)\\) and calculate the distances. Then since the other two independent variables are binary, we’ll randomly sample those for each house, say with respective probabilities \\(0.2\\) and \\(0.4\\).\n\nset.seed(370)\nN &lt;- 147\ngly_preds &lt;-\n    tibble::tibble(\n        house_x_coord = runif(N, 0, 1),\n        house_y_coord = runif(N, 0, 1),\n        dist_from_farm = sqrt((house_x_coord - 0.5)^2 + (house_y_coord - 0.5)^2),\n        personal_gly_use = rbinom(N, 1, 0.2),\n        water_filter_use = rbinom(N, 1, 0.4)\n    )\nhead(gly_preds)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  house_x_coord house_y_coord dist_from_farm personal_gly_use water_filter_use\n          &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;int&gt;            &lt;int&gt;\n1        0.390         0.852           0.369                1                1\n2        0.0519        0.373           0.466                0                0\n3        0.194         0.472           0.307                0                1\n4        0.961         0.922           0.625                0                1\n5        0.747         0.576           0.259                0                0\n6        0.0105        0.0321          0.677                0                0\n\n\nNow we need to describe our data generating model for the outcome. Of course, I am just going to randomly pick some parameters and mess around until they look about right – we know that our glyphosate levels should be somewhere in the neighborhood of \\((0, 1.4)\\)-ish. We’ll use a linear model, which means we assume that: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log(y_i^*) &\\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2) \\\\\n\\mu_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1, i} + \\beta_2 x_{2, i} + \\beta_3x_{3, i}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Here, \\(y_i\\) is the concentration of glyphosate in tap water of house \\(i\\), \\[x_{1, i}\\] is the distance from house \\(i\\) to the farm, \\(x_{2, i}\\) is the personal glyphosate use variable, and \\(x_{3, i}\\) is the water filter use variable. So we need to pick all four of those \\(\\beta_p\\) coefficients and the value of \\(\\sigma^2\\), the residual variance, before we can simulate our glyphosate levels.\n\n# Make a table of true coefs for using later\ncoefs &lt;-\n    tibble::tribble(\n        ~term, ~estimate,\n        \"(Intercept)\", 0.8,\n        \"dist_from_farm\", -4,\n        \"personal_gly_use\", 0.5,\n        \"water_filter_use\", -0.4\n    )\nres_sd &lt;- 0.25\n\ngly_data &lt;-\n    gly_preds |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(\n        mu = 0.8 - 4 * dist_from_farm + 0.5 * personal_gly_use -\n            0.4 * water_filter_use,\n        y_star = exp(rnorm(N, mu, res_sd))\n    )\n\nLoD &lt;- 0.33\n\nsummary(gly_data)\n\n house_x_coord       house_y_coord      dist_from_farm    personal_gly_use\n Min.   :0.0003474   Min.   :0.004179   Min.   :0.04354   Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:0.2796628   1st Qu.:0.243920   1st Qu.:0.25278   1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median :0.5228575   Median :0.471412   Median :0.39295   Median :0.0000  \n Mean   :0.5094258   Mean   :0.484296   Mean   :0.36918   Mean   :0.2381  \n 3rd Qu.:0.7452386   3rd Qu.:0.731020   3rd Qu.:0.46563   3rd Qu.:0.0000  \n Max.   :0.9906258   Max.   :0.998614   Max.   :0.67715   Max.   :1.0000  \n water_filter_use       mu              y_star       \n Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :-2.0985   Min.   :0.09508  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:-1.1521   1st Qu.:0.31413  \n Median :0.0000   Median :-0.7472   Median :0.47621  \n Mean   :0.3878   Mean   :-0.7128   Mean   :0.62597  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:-0.2702   3rd Qu.:0.76989  \n Max.   :1.0000   Max.   : 1.1258   Max.   :3.71580  \n\n\nYou can see from the above simulation code that the values I ended up choosing are as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log(y_i^*) &\\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu_i, 0.5^2) \\\\\n\\mu_i &= -2.5 + 2\\cdot x_{1, i} + 0.5\\cdot x_{2, i} -0.4\\cdot x_{3, i}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] These values seemed to give a reasonable range of \\(y\\) values (on the natural scale), and have signs that made sense to me. The intercept represents the concentration of glyphosate expected in tap water for a person who lives on the farm, no personal glyphosate use, and no water filter, and is about \\(2.23\\) ppm, which is quite high and perhaps expected for the point source of the contaminant. With these parameters, we will have \\(28.6\\%\\) of data points below the limit of detection, which is not ideal (of course the ideal is zero percent), but not too bad either.\nOur censoring model looks like this:\n\\[\ny_i = \\begin{cases}\nL, & y_i^* &lt; 0.33 \\text{ ppm} \\\\\ny_i^*, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}.\n\\] Our censoring indicator \\(C_i\\) will look like this:\n\\[\nc_i = \\begin{cases}\n1, & y_i^* &lt; 0.33 \\text{ ppm} \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}.\n\\] Let’s first apply the censoring to our data. We’ll arbitrarily choose \\(L = 0\\). Then we’ll take a look at the data we would actually observe.\n\n# Dataset including latent variables\n# Do the censoring\nL &lt;- 0.1\ngly_data_lnt &lt;-\n    gly_data |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(\n        # Create the censoring indicator\n        c = ifelse(y_star &lt;= LoD, 1, 0),\n        # Create the censored outcome\n        y = ifelse(c == 1, L, y_star)\n    )\n\n# Dataset including ONLY the observed variables\ngly_data_obs &lt;- gly_data_lnt |&gt;\n    dplyr::select(dist_from_farm, personal_gly_use, water_filter_use, c, y)\n\nhead(gly_data_obs)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  dist_from_farm personal_gly_use water_filter_use     c     y\n           &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;int&gt;            &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          0.369                1                1     0 0.369\n2          0.466                0                0     0 0.371\n3          0.307                0                1     1 0.1  \n4          0.625                0                1     1 0.1  \n5          0.259                0                0     0 0.913\n6          0.677                0                0     1 0.1  \n\n\nNote that setting \\(y_i = 0.1\\) if the value is censored is completely arbitrary. Many people will set it to a value like the LoD, or half the LoD, or some crazy thing with \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) in it, and then pretend those are the real values. All of these arbitrary values are equally bad. Let’s look at the distribution of the latent and observed values just to show this. In real life, we can’t see this, but this example should remind us that picking an arbitrary number is not very good.\n\n# Arrange the data correctly for plotting\ngly_data_lnt |&gt;\n    dplyr::select(\n        \"observed\" = y,\n        \"latent\" = y_star\n    ) |&gt;\n    tidyr::pivot_longer(dplyr::everything()) |&gt;\n    # Now make the plot\n    ggplot() +\n    aes(x = value) +\n    geom_histogram(\n        boundary = 0,\n        binwidth = 0.1,\n        color = \"black\",\n        fill = \"gray\"\n    ) +\n    facet_wrap(vars(name)) +\n    ggtitle(paste0(\"Censored values coded as \", L))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s also take a look at what the data would have looked like if we set, say \\(L = 0.33\\) (the LoD).\n\ngly_data_lnt |&gt;\n    # Set censored values to LoD\n    dplyr::mutate(y = ifelse(y == L, 0.33, y)) |&gt;\n    # Arrange the data for the plot\n    dplyr::select(\n        \"observed\" = y,\n        \"latent\" = y_star\n    ) |&gt;\n    tidyr::pivot_longer(dplyr::everything()) |&gt;\n    # Make the plot\n    ggplot() +\n    aes(x = value) +\n    geom_histogram(\n        boundary = 0,\n        binwidth = 0.1,\n        color = \"black\",\n        fill = \"gray\"\n    ) +\n    facet_wrap(vars(name)) +\n    ggtitle(\"Censored values coded as LoD\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see how this histogram makes the censored values look like actual data (cat screaming emoji)!! Whereas the previous set of histograms with a spike at zero should signal that there is something strange going on in the data. So substitution can cause data to be misleading. For this reason, it can sometimes be useful for analysts to record values as “Nondetect” or “&lt; LoD” in the dataset (or some other kind of text indicating it is not a regular number), forcing the analyst to clean up the data before it can be statistically examined. The problem can be somewhat avoided if we include an explicit indicator of censoring in our data, like so.\n\ngly_data_lnt |&gt;\n        # Set censored values to LoD\n    dplyr::mutate(y = ifelse(y == L, 0.33, y)) |&gt;\n    dplyr::select(\n        \"observed\" = y,\n        \"latent\" = y_star,\n        c\n    ) |&gt;\n    tidyr::pivot_longer(-c) |&gt;\n    # Now make the plot\n    ggplot() +\n    aes(x = value, fill = factor(c)) +\n    geom_histogram(\n        boundary = 0,\n        binwidth = 0.1,\n        color = \"black\",\n        alpha = 0.5,\n        position = \"stack\"\n    ) +\n    facet_wrap(vars(name)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\"), name  = \"Below LoD?\") +\n    ggtitle(paste0(\"Censored values coded as LoD\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngly_data_lnt |&gt;\n    dplyr::select(\n        \"observed\" = y,\n        \"latent\" = y_star,\n        c\n    ) |&gt;\n    tidyr::pivot_longer(-c) |&gt;\n    # Now make the plot\n    ggplot() +\n    aes(x = value, fill = factor(c)) +\n    geom_histogram(\n        boundary = 0,\n        binwidth = 0.1,\n        color = \"black\",\n        alpha = 0.5,\n        position = \"stack\"\n    ) +\n    facet_wrap(vars(name)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\"), name  = \"Below LoD?\") +\n    ggtitle(paste0(\"Censored values coded as \", L))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we can see that the histogram conflates part of the censored and non-censored values because of the binwidth we set. All that is to show, when there is a possibly of censored data, we should be extra careful as analysts to make sure we aren’t computing incorrect statistics.\nAs another instructive example, let us first attempt to estimate the mean and SD of the glyphosate concentrations. We know an unbiased estimate of marginal mean and CI (that is, the statistic if we ignore all of the x values), because we have the underlying latent values. So let’s estimate those first. (Because we have a normal distribution, we could probably get the analytical marginal mean assuming unknown \\(x_i, p\\) values, but we won’t do that here.) In R, we can quickly construct the Wald-type CI based on the t-distribution using the t.test() function.\n\nlatent_t_test &lt;-\n    gly_data_lnt$y_star |&gt;\n    # Remember we made a log-normal assumption so we take the log here\n    log() |&gt;\n    t.test() |&gt;\n    broom::tidy() |&gt;\n    # Re-exponentiate the results\n    dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(c(estimate, conf.low, conf.high), exp))\nprint(latent_t_test)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 8\n  estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      \n1    0.485     -12.5 1.05e-24       146    0.432     0.544 One Samp… two.sided  \n\n\nNow, if we compute the same test using the observed values, we can see what happens.\n\nobserved_t_test &lt;-\n    gly_data_obs$y |&gt;\n    # Remember we made a log-normal assumption so we take the log here\n    log() |&gt;\n    t.test() |&gt;\n    broom::tidy() |&gt;\n    # Re-exponentiate the results\n    dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(c(estimate, conf.low, conf.high), exp))\nprint(observed_t_test)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 8\n  estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      \n1    0.391     -11.7 8.40e-23       146    0.334     0.458 One Samp… two.sided  \n\n\nThe estimate is much lower! In fact, the 95% CI doesn’t even cover the latent estimate! Of course, we can arbitrarily change the estimate by recoding the censored values. If we bumped them up to the LoD, the estimate would go up and if we made them lower, it would go down.\nDespite knowing this, let’s see what happens in our linear model.",

    "text": "2.3 Integration method for censored data\nWe can regain some measure of our lost diginity using the integration trick we discussed in the introduction. Of course, in the introduction, we only talked about adjusting for censoring in the univariate case, but fortunately we are modeling the conditional distribution of \\(y\\) so we can use the same trick:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\theta \\mid y_i, x_i \\right) &= f_{Y_i \\mid X_i = x_i}(y_i \\mid \\theta, x_i) \\\\\n&= \\bigg( f(y_i \\mid \\theta, x) \\bigg)^{1 - c_i} \\bigg( P(Y_i = y_i \\mid x)\\bigg)^{c_i} \\\\\n&= \\bigg( f(y_i \\mid \\theta, x_i) \\bigg)^{1 - c_i} \\bigg( \\int_{-\\infty}^{y_\\min} f(y_i \\mid \\theta, x_i) \\ dy_i \\bigg)^{c_i} \\\\\n&= \\bigg( f(y_i \\mid \\theta, x_i) \\bigg)^{1 - c_i} \\bigg( F(y_\\min \\mid \\theta, x_i) \\bigg)^{c_i}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe likelihood for \\(y_i\\) is easy to write out here since the censoring structure is (relatively) simple. This gives rise to the likelihood of the sample, which (under the assumption of mutual conditional independence) is \\[\n\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\theta \\mid x, y \\right) =  \\prod_{i = 1}^n \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\theta \\mid y_i, x_i \\right).\n\\]\nNow that we’ve conducted the likelihood, we can do either of the usual things we would do to estimate the parameters: find the argument \\(\\theta\\) that maximizes the likelihood, or apply some priors and use an algorithm to estimate a Bayesian posterior.\nDoing either of these is not too complicated for this specific example – we can easily write a function to optimize, or we could do some kind of grid or quadratic posterior approximation. For this example, neither of those is very difficult and should converge easily. But, we have the benefit of excellent statistical tools that have already been written, so we might as well use them.\n\n2.3.1 Frequentist models\nThe R package survival (which actually predates the R language) implements parametric models of this form for many common distributions. Don’t let the name fool you: we can do models other than survival analysis. In this particular case, we just need to specify a parametric model with a normal distribution and left censoring. The syntax for this is a bit strange, we need to use the Surv() function to set up a “survival object” which we pass as the response variable in the survreg() function.\n\n# First we have to transform the outcome\nsurv_model &lt;- survival::survreg(\n    # Creating the \"survival time\" outcome\n    survival::Surv(\n        # If the value is lower than LoD, replace it w/ LoD, then take the log\n        pmax(y, LoD) |&gt; log(),\n        # The censoring indicator needs to be the opposite of what makes sense --\n        # zero for censored, one for uncensored -- it's actually an indicator of\n        # an \"event\" occurring, for us this is the event\n        # \"getting a reliable measurement.\"\n        !c,\n        # Specify left censoring\n        type = 'left'\n    ) ~\n        # All the other linear model stuff as usual\n        dist_from_farm + personal_gly_use + water_filter_use,\n    data = gly_data_obs,\n    dist = \"gaussian\"\n)\n\nsurv_model |&gt;\n    broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) |&gt;\n    tibble::add_column(truth = c(coefs$estimate, log(res_sd))) |&gt;\n    dplyr::select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high, truth) |&gt;\n    knitr::kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nconf.low\nconf.high\ntruth\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.735\n0.588\n0.882\n0.800\n\n\ndist_from_farm\n-3.854\n-4.245\n-3.463\n-4.000\n\n\npersonal_gly_use\n0.537\n0.423\n0.651\n0.500\n\n\nwater_filter_use\n-0.388\n-0.494\n-0.282\n-0.400\n\n\nLog(scale)\n-1.264\nNA\nNA\n-1.386\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite all the finagling we have to do, we can see that the estimates are now much better. Although the point estimates are not as close as we would expect if we had the latent uncensored outcome variable, the confidence intervals actually contain the true values this time. (Note that Log(scale) is the estimated residual SD on the log scale, but for some reason the CI doesn’t get calculated by any of the survival methods.) Notably, the CIs for this model are actually smaller than the the CIs for the naive model, even though we’re assuming there is extra uncertainty in the outcome. But we have accounted for this uncertainty in the model, so it doesn’t leak into the parameter estimates (of course that’s a non-technical explanation).\nThe worst part here is doing all that Surv() stuff, but fortunately there are ways to avoid having to do all that. This method is commonly called the “Tobit model” in econometrics, and there is a well-developed literature around this model, and some variations and extensions. In particular, the AER package provides a function called tobit() that allows one to specify these kind of simple censoring models in standard R syntax, and automatically does the conversion to a survreg() model.\n\ntobit_model &lt;- AER::tobit(\n    log(y) ~ dist_from_farm + personal_gly_use + water_filter_use,\n    data = gly_data_obs,\n    left = log(LoD),\n    right = Inf,\n    dist = \"gaussian\"\n)\n\nsummary(tobit_model)\n\n\nCall:\nAER::tobit(formula = log(y) ~ dist_from_farm + personal_gly_use + \n    water_filter_use, left = log(LoD), right = Inf, dist = \"gaussian\", \n    data = gly_data_obs)\n\nObservations:\n         Total  Left-censored     Uncensored Right-censored \n           147             42            105              0 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

For this example, we know that the parameters actually have “true values” so assigning a degenerate prior would actually reflect our true beliefs, but it’s silly. So we’ll assign some usual weakly informative priors that will help our model work right. If you want to do the priors with the variance of 10000 to be “objective” or whatever you can do that but I don’t think it’s a good idea. I’ll base my priors largely on the advice in Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath and the Stan Prior Choice Guide.\nWe need a prior for everything in our model that isn’t observed in the data. For this model, that’s our residual variance and the beta coefficients. We’ll set the priors as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta_j &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}\\left(0, 3\\right), \\quad j = {0, 1, 2, 3}; \\\\\n\\sigma &\\sim \\text{Half-t}\\left(0, 3, \\nu = 3\\right).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] here, we use \\(\\mathrm{t}\\left(\\mu, \\sigma, \\nu\\right)\\) to denote the location-scale Student’s \\(t\\)-dsitribution with \\(\\nu\\) degrees of freedom. We use normal distributions centered at 0 for the \\(\\beta_j\\) to indicate our skepticism about the strength of the effects (if we were to pretend we didn’t know the generative model). Because \\(\\sigma\\) must be postive, we actually use the “half” version of the distribution, which has strictly positive support.\nNow, for this kind of model where only the outcome is censored, we can actually have the super-handy brms R package do the heavy lifting for us. All we have to do is a bit of data cleaning, and a bit of working specifying the model structure, but the package will handle writing, compiling, and running all of the Stan code, which is very conveninent. First we’ll fit the naive model, to show the brms syntax, and then we’ll cover the censored adjustment.\n\n2.3.2.1 naive model in brms\nAt first glance, the brms syntax appears to be quite difficult to use. While complex, it is concise and specifying the syntax is much less difficult than writing Stan code for many models. Fitting a brms model broadly requires 5 things from us: the first two are the formula, in lm() type syntax with a few extras, and the data, as we expect. We also need to specify a distributional family argument for the likelihood, which we implicitly do when we call lm(). As with base R, the gaussian likelihood is the default in brms, but it’s good practice to be clear. We also need to specify the priors, which are written in a specific way, and the Stan control parameters which control the Bayesian routine. Because brms is a wrapper for Stan’s NUTS sampler, the fitting routine is much more complicated than the routine for lm() and there’s a lot we can change.\nIf we just ignore these arguments, we can still get some results. Note that when you run a brms model like this, you’ll first get a compiling message, then several intermittant progress updates about how fitting is going. I have those silenced here because it generates a lot of them.\n\nbasic_brms_fit &lt;- brms::brm(\n    formula = log(y) ~ 1 + dist_from_farm + personal_gly_use + water_filter_use,\n    data = gly_data_obs,\n    silent = 2\n)\n\n\nsummary(basic_brms_fit)\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: log(y) ~ 1 + dist_from_farm + personal_gly_use + water_filter_use \n   Data: gly_data_obs (Number of observations: 147) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 4000\n\nRegression Coefficients:\n                 Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept            0.97      0.12     0.74     1.20 1.00     4615     2983\ndist_from_farm      -5.13      0.28    -5.68    -4.58 1.00     4761     2902\npersonal_gly_use     0.77      0.10     0.57     0.95 1.00     4472     2826\nwater_filter_use    -0.50      0.08    -0.66    -0.33 1.00     5215     3088\n\nFurther Distributional Parameters:\n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma     0.50      0.03     0.44     0.56 1.00     4653     2929\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).

The estimates here are very similar to the estimates from the naive frequentist model. Let’s apply some priors and some Stan arguments and see what happens. First, we’ll set up the priors.\nI recommend reading the brms documentation and papers to learn more about how this prior syntax works, but we can also take a look at the default priors that brms set for our basic model.\n\nprior_summary(basic_brms_fit)\n\n                   prior     class             coef group resp dpar nlpar lb ub\n                  (flat)         b                                             \n                  (flat)         b   dist_from_farm                            \n                  (flat)         b personal_gly_use                            \n                  (flat)         b water_filter_use                            \n student_t(3, -0.7, 2.5) Intercept                                             \n    student_t(3, 0, 2.5)     sigma                                         0   \n       source\n      default\n (vectorized)\n (vectorized)\n (vectorized)\n      default\n      default\n\n\nHere, we can see that the coefficients have (flat) priors, which often works for this simple of a model, but is usually not a good choice because it can be difficult for the sampler. The default prior for sigma, the residual SD, is very similar to what I picked, and I think is generally a good default prior. Anyways, based on the class column from this output, we can figure out how to set up a prior. Note that the lb for sigma is the lower bound.\n\nmy_priors &lt;- c(\n    prior(normal(0, 3), class = \"b\"),\n    prior(normal(0, 3), class = \"Intercept\"),\n    prior(student_t(3, 0, 3), class = \"sigma\", lb = 0)\n)\n\nmy_priors\n\n              prior     class coef group resp dpar nlpar   lb   ub source\n       normal(0, 3)         b                            &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;   user\n       normal(0, 3) Intercept                            &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;   user\n student_t(3, 0, 3)     sigma                               0 &lt;NA&gt;   user\n\n\nEverything else we pass in, other than these four arguments, will be Stan control parameters. If you want to learn about Stan specifics, there are way better resources than this, so I recommend you read those. I just want to make it clear that these other things are telling Stan how it should run the fitting routine.\n\nnaive_brms_fit &lt;- brms::brm(\n    formula = log(y) ~ dist_from_farm + personal_gly_use + water_filter_use,\n    data = gly_data_obs,\n    family = gaussian(),\n    prior = my_priors,\n    warmup = 1000,\n    iter = 2000,\n    chains = 4,\n    cores = 4,\n    seed = 32134,\n    backend = \"cmdstanr\",\n    silent = 2\n)\n\n\nsummary(naive_brms_fit)\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: log(y) ~ dist_from_farm + personal_gly_use + water_filter_use \n   Data: gly_data_obs (Number of observations: 147) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 4000\n\nRegression Coefficients:\n                 Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept            0.95      0.12     0.71     1.20 1.00     4620     3214\ndist_from_farm      -5.09      0.29    -5.66    -4.53 1.00     4741     2952\npersonal_gly_use     0.77      0.10     0.57     0.96 1.00     4409     3002\nwater_filter_use    -0.50      0.09    -0.67    -0.33 1.00     4721     3286\n\nFurther Distributional Parameters:\n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma     0.50      0.03     0.44     0.56 1.00     4308     3027\n\nDraws were sampled using sample(hmc).

Again, that’s because a simple linear model with data generated from a linear model is really easy to handle. Once you start getting into more complicated models, the priors and stan arguments can matter a lot. But now that we’ve got all that taken care of, we should talk about censoring.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 censored model in brms\nIn brms, we can handle censoring by a special formula syntax that tells the model to do a likelihood adjustment. Notably, how to do this is kind of buried in the documentation. And at time of writing, it never explains that the likelihood adjustment is what it actually does (but it is). The best place to read about this functionality and other additional options for brms is on this page of the documentation. We need to do a bit of data cleaning first before we can handle the censoring though. As you can see on that page, we need our censoring indicator variable to contain -1 for left-censored data, instead of 1 like we currently have. The censoring bound should be given in y, so we need to transform it again so that all censored values are written down as the actual LoD.\n\nbrms_data &lt;-\n    gly_data_obs |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(\n        # Transform censoring indicator\n        censored = ifelse(c == 1, -1, 0),\n        # Transform the outcome\n        outcome = pmax(log(y), log(LoD)),\n        # Only keep the variables we plan to give to brms\n        .keep = \"unused\"\n    )\n\nhead(brms_data)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  dist_from_farm personal_gly_use water_filter_use censored outcome\n           &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;int&gt;            &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          0.369                1                1        0 -0.997 \n2          0.466                0                0        0 -0.991 \n3          0.307                0                1       -1 -1.11  \n4          0.625                0                1       -1 -1.11  \n5          0.259                0                0        0 -0.0908\n6          0.677                0                0       -1 -1.11  \n\n\nNow we can fit the brms model with the censoring correction.\n\ncens_brms_fit &lt;- brms::brm(\n    formula = outcome | cens(censored) ~ dist_from_farm + personal_gly_use +\n        water_filter_use,\n    data = brms_data,\n    family = gaussian(),\n    prior = my_priors,\n    warmup = 1000,\n    iter = 2000,\n    chains = 4,\n    cores = 4,\n    seed = 32134,\n    backend = \"cmdstanr\",\n    silent = 2\n)\n\n\nsummary(cens_brms_fit)\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: outcome | cens(censored) ~ dist_from_farm + personal_gly_use + water_filter_use \n   Data: brms_data (Number of observations: 147) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 4000\n\nRegression Coefficients:\n                 Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept            0.73      0.08     0.58     0.88 1.00     4699     2549\ndist_from_farm      -3.86      0.20    -4.24    -3.48 1.00     4206     3284\npersonal_gly_use     0.54      0.06     0.42     0.66 1.00     4619     3286\nwater_filter_use    -0.39      0.06    -0.50    -0.28 1.00     4747     3042\n\nFurther Distributional Parameters:\n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma     0.29      0.02     0.25     0.34 1.00     4037     2797\n\nDraws were sampled using sample(hmc). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS\nand Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential\nscale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).\n\n\nAgain, our results are similar to the frequentist model. All of the true values are now inside of the estimated 95% credible intervals, with the one exception of sigma, the residual SD, which had a true value of 0.25 – so we’ll say it’s inside the credible interval up to measurement/computer precision, there’s no way that small of a difference would practically matter.\nUnfortunately, not every model can be handled with brms, even though it’s very flexible. For example, when we talk about censored predictor values, we won’t be able to use brms for the approach we’ll use. Instead, we’ll have to write our own Stan code, which is even more flexible than brms (though it lacks many of the convenience features).\n\n\n2.3.2.3 Custom Stan code with cmdstanr\nMoving from using only R to writing a Stan program is the biggest jump we have to make in our quest to deal with censored data. If you don’t know anything about Stan, I recommend the Statistical Rethinking book mentioned earlier, as the associated rethinking package is quite easy to use to specify a lot of basic statistical models (with guidance from the text), and provides a method to view the Stan code generated by a model. The brms package also provides the stancode() method, but the Stan code generated by brms employs many tips to make the model more efficient, and so can be difficult to interpret if you aren’t familiar with Stan.\nAnyways, I don’t plan to explain the details of writing Stan code here, like I mentioned with brms and the R language and even the statistics stuff we’re doing, there are a lot better resources you can find with a quick google that are better than what I could write. So instead I already wrote the Stan code, and here’s the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel code\n\n\n\n\n\n//\n// Dealing with a censored outcome in linear regression using the\n// integration approach\n// author: Zane Billings\n// started: 2024-05-18\n//\n\n// The input data consists of:\n// - n (positive integer): the number of data records\n// - p (positive integer): number of covariates to include.\n// - y (vector of real numbers): the outcome, assumed to follow a normal\n//   distribution where the mean is based on a linear model.\n// - c (array of integers that must be 0 or 1): should be 0 if the corresponding\n//   observation in y is completely observed, or 1 if the observation is\n//   censored (below the detection limit).\n// - X (n x p matrix where p is the number of predictors): the matrix of\n//   covariates to use in the linear model.\n// - DL (real scalar): the lower limit of detection for the observed values of\n//   the outcome variable, y. This must be less than or equal to the smallest\n//   observed value of the outcome.\ndata {\n\tint&lt;lower=1&gt; n;\n\tint&lt;lower=1&gt; p;\n\tvector[n] y;\n\tarray[n] int&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; c;\n\tmatrix[n, p] X;\n\treal&lt;upper=min(y)&gt; DL;\n}\n\n// The parameters accepted by the model.\n// - alpha (real scalar): the intercept\n// - beta (real vector of length P): vector of slope coefficients\n// - sigma (positive real scalar): the residual variance.\nparameters {\n\treal alpha;\n\tvector[p] beta;\n\treal&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma;\n}\n\n// The model to be estimated.

If c[i] = 1,\n\t// we need to do the integration thing.\n\t// For this simple case where all the detection limits are the same, we could\n\t// vectorize this. But this is easier to read.\n\tfor (i in 1:n) {\n\t\tif (c[i] == 0) {\n\t\t\ty[i] ~ normal(mu[i], sigma);\n\t\t} else if (c[i] == 1) {\n\t\t\ttarget += normal_lcdf(DL | mu[i], sigma);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\n\nNow we can talk about running Stan code in R, which I actually will talk a bit about. Once you have the Stan file set up, you have to figure out how to get Stan running. I’ll use (and recommend that everyone else) use cmdstanr, which is an R package you can install. You’ll need to do some extra setup if you’ve never used the package before, so follow their guide and I strongly recommend following the steps outside of an R project, just open the base R gui and copy and paste their code.\nOnce you have cmdstanr installed, the first thing we need to do is load the Stan file and compile the model. I almost always prefer to do this in two separate steps in case I need to control or force the compilation step.\n\nstan_pth &lt;- here::here(pth_base, \"censored-outcome-integration.stan\")\nstan_mod &lt;- cmdstanr::cmdstan_model(stan_file = stan_pth, compile = FALSE)\n\nThe stan_mod object is set up with cmdstanr now, so it knows where to find the Stan code it will need to run. If you try to print that object, it will print the Stan code and will also tell you if there are any syntactical errors in the code. Since there are no syntactical errors, we can try and compile the Stan code. This step is likely not familiar if you only use R code. Stan code needs to be translated into machine-level language before it can be run, which dramatically speeds up the run time for complex models. This creates an .exe file which can be run by cmdstanr without needing to compile again. Here I’ll compile in pedantic mode which will give you suggestions on common issues that can make your model worse, without explicitly causing errors. This will spit out a lot of messages that I’ve elected to hide. They aren’t very useful most of the time.\n\nstan_mod$compile(pedantic = TRUE, force_recompile = TRUE)\n\nNow that the program is compiled, we need to set up our data in a specific format before we can run the HMC sampler. Stan accepts data in an R list() format, where each of the items can be different sizes and types. You can see in the data{} section of the printed Stan code what items you need to put in the list, and what their types should be. So we’ll do some quick data cleaning.\n\nstan_data &lt;- list(\n    # Number of data points\n    n = nrow(gly_data_obs),\n    # number of predictors\n    p = 3,\n    # vector of outcome values\n    y = brms_data$outcome,\n    # Vector of censoring indicators\n    c = gly_data_obs$c,\n    # Matrix of predictor values (size n x 3)\n    X = with(\n        gly_data_obs,\n        matrix(\n            c(dist_from_farm, personal_gly_use, water_filter_use),\n            ncol = 3\n        )\n    ),\n    # limit of detection -- needs to be on same scale as y vector\n    DL = log(LoD)\n)\nstr(stan_data, 1)\n\nList of 6\n $ n : int 147\n $ p : num 3\n $ y : num [1:147] -0.997 -0.9906 -1.1087 -1.1087 -0.0908 ...\n $ c : num [1:147] 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ X : num [1:147, 1:3] 0.369 0.466 0.307 0.625 0.259 ...\n $ DL: num -1.11\n\n\nWith the data in this format, we can go ahead and pass it to Stan and invoke the sampler. Since all of the model options are specified in the actual Stan code file this time, everything we pass to the sample() method is a control argument for how cmdstan runs the sampler.\n\nstan_fit &lt;- stan_mod$sample(\n    data = stan_data,\n    seed = 10896,\n    chains = 4,\n    parallel_chains = 4,\n    iter_sampling = 4000,\n    iter_warmup = 1000,\n    refresh = 0\n)\n\n\nstan_fit$summary()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n  variable   mean median     sd    mad     q5    q95  rhat ess_bulk ess_tail\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 lp__     57.9   58.2   1.63   1.43   54.7   59.9    1.00    6723.    9400.\n2 alpha     0.733  0.733 0.0764 0.0761  0.608  0.859  1.00    8918.    9308.\n3 beta[1]  -3.86  -3.86  0.204  0.205  -4.20  -3.53   1.00    9249.    9271.\n4 beta[2]   0.539  0.538 0.0608 0.0611  0.440  0.639  1.00   14857.   10546.\n5 beta[3]  -0.388 -0.388 0.0564 0.0557 -0.483 -0.297  1.00   14272.   10411.\n6 sigma     0.291  0.290 0.0211 0.0208  0.259  0.329  1.00   14809.   10120.\n\n\nIf you compare the numbers between this fit and the brms fit, they’re pretty much exactly the same. Again, it’s largely because this model is so simple. If we were doing a more complicated brms-compatible model, the brms fit would probably be a bit better cause of all the tricks it does to write the Stan code in an efficient way. But for models with censored predictors we’ll have to use our own Stan code, so it’s worth seeing how to do it for this relatively easier case.",

This method of adjusting the likelihood generalizes to arbitrarily complex models as long as the outcome follows this kind of simple censoring pattern. This method also generalizes to each observaiton of the outcome having a different limit of detection, and we can have both upper and lower LoDs, or even interval censoring patterns, as long as we know and we can write down the censoring limits for each observation. But we’ll discuss more of that kind of stuff in future examples.\nBecause only the outcome is censored, there are a lot of methods available to us for dealing with this kind of data, including pre-built methods in survival for frequentist ML models, and brms for Bayesian models.

    "text": "Appendix: notes on modeling\nSince this is a simple example focused on dealing with the censoring adjustment, I decided not to get into the weeds about modeling anywhere else. There are a few technical choices I made/didn’t make, so I decided to write them down here for posterity, without cluttering up the main text.\n\nYou should definitely use cmdstanr for running Stan models. In general, it stays up to date much better, is a bit easier to use, and is compatible with almost everything rstan is (and the formats are interchangable). It can be annoying to install, but it’s worth the hassle.\nA lot of people like flat or very diffuse priors because they are “objective”. I dislike them for a number of reasons. First of all, they often reduce the ability of the model to sample efficiently. Second, due to the inherent researcher degrees of freedom in setting up the model structure and what data are present, I don’t think talking about the “objectivity” of priors makes any sense. Finally, the priors represent our prior beliefs about the parameters, and a flat prior means we think any possible value is equally likely. This is why people often think this is an “objective” prior but I think that’s silly. I certainly don’t think my beta coefficient is equally likely to be 1 vs. negative three billion and seven, but that’s what the flat prior says. In general, I know the effect should be fairly weak, so we should use skeptical priors that allow the parameter to get larger if the data support that.\nIn general for “generic priors”, I tend to prefer \\(t\\) and half-\\(t\\) priors with 3 degrees of freedom. These have thicker tails than normal/half-normal priors, but not as thick as Cauchy priors, which some people will recommend. A Cauchy prior reflects a belief that the variance of a variable is infinite, which is not plausible to me, and Cauchy priors also cause sampling efficiency to plummet in many cases without much of a benefit. So in general if I had to pick a “generic default prior” it would be \\(t\\) with three degrees of freedom.\nI didn’t talk about centering and scaling here, but in general you should typically scale your variables (e.g. divide by the MAD) before putting them into Stan, simply because it helps the sampler.\nCentering can also be helpful, and if you want to do any kind of variable selection or comparison between variables, you need to center them. Centering can make coefficient interpretations more difficult, but one of the benefits of Bayesian modeling is that any posterior calculation we want to make comes with an entire posterior distribution of estimates, so we never have to worry about figuring out CIs for a posteriori calculations. In general it’s often better to do these kind of computational tricks to make the model fit efficiently, and then do transformations and predictions of interest afterwards.",

    "text": "Appendix: imputation methods\nThe other approach to dealing with censoring is to use a constrained imputation method. In general, multiple imputation (MI) works well with Bayesian inference, and you can implement MI and subsequent pooling methods to correct for censoring, so long as the MI method can be constrained to account for the limits on censored values.\nIn addition to standard MI methods, you can also impute values within the Stan model – this is a big advantages of Bayesian methods. I won’t go into details about either of these imputation methods, but for a brief discussion you can read this StackExchange post. The Stan manual has an example of this as well. Similar imputation methods are covered in books like Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al, and we can account for censoring by specifying constraints.",

    "text": "4.1 Data simulation\nAs usual, we’ll begin our data simulation by writing out the true data generating process (likelihood model) that we’ll use to generate the data. This model is a bit complicated–of course we’ll have the same regression part of the model as we’ve had before, that relates the latent \\(y^*\\) values to the latent \\(x^*\\) values. But then the observation model will include a censoring scheme for the observation of both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nImportantly, in this model we also need to specify a distributional assumption for \\(X\\), otherwise we can’t estimate what the uncensored \\(X\\) values should look like. So for the sake of simplicity, we’ll assume a Gaussian distribution for the \\(x\\)-values as well, although this is definitely something we need to think more about in the future. Furthermore, let’s assume \\(x\\) has a standard normal distribution, since we can standardize \\(x\\) before modeling.\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny_i &= \\begin{cases}\ny_\\min, & y_i^* \\leq y_\\min \\\\\ny_i^* & y_\\min &lt; y_i^* \\leq y_\\max \\\\\ny_\\max &  y_\\max &lt; y_i^*\n\\end{cases} \\\\\nx_i &= \\begin{cases}\nx_\\min, & x_i^* \\leq x_\\min \\\\\nx_i^* & x_\\min &lt; x_i^* \\leq x_\\max \\\\\nx_\\max &  x_\\max &lt; x_i^*\n\\end{cases} \\\\\ny^*_i &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2) \\\\\n\\mu_i &= \\alpha + \\beta \\cdot x^*_i \\\\\nx_i^* &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(0, 1)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nAgain, we can choose whatever parameters we want for the simulation.

Thus, \\(24.75\\%\\) of records were censored in some way.\nI also deliberately set the upper and lower limits for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be asymmetrical so we can more clearly see how our censoring process can strongly bias the estimates: we have more records censored at lower values than higher values, which gives us a shifted window where we observe data.\nSo now that we have the data simulated, we want to try to recover the original parameters with a Bayesian model.",

    "text": "6.1 Model with one patient group\nFor the first model, we’ll consider a simpler case where we only have one group of patients. This model would be appropriate for, e.g., an observational study where all patients are given the vaccine of interest.\nThe data generating model is as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny_i &\\sim \\text{Bernoulli}\\left(p\\right) \\\\\n\\mathrm{logit}(p) &= \\alpha + \\beta \\cdot x_i\n\\end{align*}\n\\] where \\(y_i\\) is a binary outcome where 1 indicates infection and 0 indicates no infection, and \\(x_i\\) is our antibody titer. However, the specific problem we deal with in practice is that these antibody titers tend to have lower limits of detection. Thus, we need to add an observation model to our data generating process to reflect the incomplete observations we obtain of \\(x\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny_i &\\sim \\text{Bernoulli}\\left(p_i\\right) \\\\\n\\mathrm{logit}(p_i) &= \\alpha + \\beta \\cdot x^*_i \\\\\nx_i^* &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}\\left(\\mu_x, \\sigma^2_x\\right) \\\\\nx_i &= \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{LoD}, & x^*_i &lt; \\mathrm{LoD} \\\\\nx^*_i, & x^*_i \\geq \\mathrm{LoD}\n\\end{cases} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\] Here, we assume that we work with the \\(x\\) variable on the log scale at all times,\nmostly cause it’s annoying and confusing to write out all the logs every time, so we could also write \\[x_i^* = \\mathrm{log} \\left(z^*_i\\right)\\] and say \\(z^*_i\\) is the actual latent un-logged titer.\nNow that we have the data generating process written out, we can simulate some example data. Note that in this example, we can interpret \\(\\alpha\\) as the log-odds of infection if a person were to have no antibodies. For example, if we assume that this probability is \\(50\\%\\) we would apply the logit transformation to get that \\(\\alpha = 0\\). However, let’s assume that the inoculum dose is quite high and during our subject selection process we’ve included anyone who might have a genetic resistance to the disease (i.e., FUT2- individuals for norovirus). So let’s say if a person has zero antibodies, their probably of getting sick should be \\(90\\%\\). Then, \\(\\log(0.9 / 0.1) \\approx 2.2\\).\nWe then want our true \\(\\beta\\) value to be negative, indicating that as the number of antibodies rise, the log-odds of infection decrease. We can interpret \\(\\beta\\) as the change in the log-odds ratio associated with a one-unit change in antibody titer – the nonlinearity here makes it a bit more difficult to interpret this effect. We can, however, intercept \\(\\exp(\\beta)\\) as the odds ratio between individuals with titer \\(x_i + 1\\) and individuals with titer \\(x_i\\). This corresponds to a nonlinear change in risk that depends on the value of \\(x_i\\). However, if we want the odds of infection to halve for each 1 unit increase in antibody titer, we would set \\(\\beta = -\\log(2) \\approx -0.7\\).\n\nset.seed(134125)\nsim_parms &lt;- list(\n    n = 110,\n    alpha = 2.2,\n    beta = -1.37,\n    mu_x = 2,\n    sigma_x = 2,\n    LoD = 0\n)\n\n\ninv_logit &lt;- function(x) {return(1 / (1 + exp(-x)))}\n\nsim_one_group &lt;- function(n, alpha, beta, mu_x, sigma_x, LoD) {\n    out &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n        x_star = rnorm(n, mu_x, sigma_x),\n        x = ifelse(x_star &lt; LoD, 0.5 * LoD, x_star),\n        p = inv_logit(alpha + beta * x_star),\n        y = rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = p)\n    )\n}\n\nsim_data &lt;- do.call(sim_one_group, sim_parms)\n\nOf course visualizing the relationship between a binary outcome and a continuous predictor is in some sense more complex than visualizing the relationship between a continuous outcome and a continuous predictor.\nFirst, let’s look at how the distribution of the predictor variable changes if we condition on the outcome.\n\nsim_data |&gt;\n    tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = c(x, x_star)) |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(\n        yf = factor(\n            y,\n            levels = c(0, 1),\n            labels = c(\"Not infected\", \"Infected\")\n        ),\n        name = factor(\n            name,\n            levels = c(\"x_star\", \"x\"),\n            labels = c(\"Latent variable\", \"Observed variable\")\n        )\n    ) |&gt;\n    ggplot() +\n    aes(x = value, fill = yf) +\n    geom_vline(\n        xintercept = 0,\n        linetype = \"dashed\",\n        color = \"black\",\n        linewidth = 1\n    ) +\n    geom_histogram(\n        binwidth = 0.5, boundary = 0, closed = \"left\",\n        position = \"identity\", alpha = 0.6,\n        color = \"black\"\n    ) +\n    scale_x_continuous(\n        name = \"Simulated log titer\",\n        breaks = scales::breaks_pretty()\n    ) +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_pretty()) +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\", name = NULL) +\n    facet_wrap(facets = vars(name))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially everything below our lower threshold gets bumped up, which will make the summary statistics of the distribution more similar between groups for the observed titer values than they would have been for the latent titer values.

    "text": "6.2 Effect of vaccine\nOf course, a more interesting question is when we have \\(k\\) different treatment groups. These groups could be vaccine and placebo, like the example that motivated this project, or they could be multiple different vaccine candidates, doses, etc. So we now need to incorporate the effect of the treatment into the model. However, we know that the treatment will have a direct effect on \\(x\\), the antibody titers, and we can add a direct effect on \\(y\\) to represent the combined effect of the vaccine on other facets of the immune system (e.g. cell-mediated responses) which explain variations in infection risk that are not due to antibodies.\nIn this framework, \\(x\\) becomes a mediator of the relationship between \\(t\\), the treatment, and \\(y\\). For simplicity, we model the effect of \\(t\\) on \\(x\\), and the effect of \\(t\\) and \\(x\\) jointly on \\(y\\), both as linear functions of the predictors. Specifically, the data generating model is given as follows.\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny_i &\\sim \\text{Bernoulli}\\left(p_i\\right) \\\\\n\\mathrm{logit}(p_i) &= \\beta_{1, T[i]} + \\beta_{2, T[i]} \\cdot x^*_i \\\\\n\\log\\left(x_i^*\\right) &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}\\left(\\mu_x, \\sigma^2_x\\right) \\\\\n\\mu_x &= \\alpha_{T[i]} \\\\\nx_i &= \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{LoD}, & x^*_i &lt; \\mathrm{LoD} \\\\\nx^*_i, & x^*_i \\geq \\mathrm{LoD}\n\\end{cases} \\\\\nT[i] &= \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{individual } i \\text{ is in the placebo group} \\\\\n2, & \\text{individual } i \\text{ is in the vaccine group}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nGiven the generative model, we can simulate data which follow our assumptions.\n\nset.seed(341341)\n# Some parameters are commented out because I originally had a global\n# intercept for mu and for p, but then the intercept parameters are\n# nonidentifiable under index coding as written.\nsim2_parms &lt;- list(\n    n = 116,\n    #a0 = 2,\n    a1 = c(2.5, 4),\n    #b0 = 1.5,\n    b1 = c(1.7, 2.2),\n    b2 = c(-0.67, -1.37),\n    sigma_x = 1.5,\n    LoD = 3,\n    latent = TRUE\n)\nsim_two_groups &lt;- function(n, b1, b2, a1, sigma_x, LoD,\n                                                     latent = TRUE) {\n    out &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n        # Randomly assign each individual to 1 (placebo) or 2 (vaccine)\n        t = rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.5) + 1,\n        mu = a1[t],\n        x_star = rnorm(n, mu, sigma_x),\n        x = dplyr::if_else(x_star &lt; LoD, 0.5 * LoD, x_star),\n        p = inv_logit(b1[t] + b2[t] * x_star),\n        y = rbinom(n, 1, prob = p)\n    )\n    \n    # If the arg 'latent' is specified as anything other than FALSE, return the\n    # latent variables that we don't observe.

Note that this analysis is marginal to the censored \\(x_i\\) values, and since the data generating process for \\(y_i\\) relies on the latent \\(x^*_i\\) values, this analysis should not be biased by the censoring process.\nHowever, in our study we specifically want to know how much of the lower risk is explained by the antibody titer, and how much is not. This analysis is more complicated, and requires us to use a regression model. Fortunately we know the data generating process, so writing the Stan code for an accurate model is not too hard.\n\n\nmod_pth &lt;- here::here(pth_base, \"Ex4b.stan\")\nmod4b &lt;- cmdstanr::cmdstan_model(mod_pth, compile = F)\nmod4b$compile(pedantic = TRUE, force_recompile = TRUE)\n\nIn file included from stan/lib/stan_math/stan/math/prim/prob/von_mises_lccdf.hpp:5,\n                 from stan/lib/stan_math/stan/math/prim/prob/von_mises_ccdf_log.hpp:4,\n                 from stan/lib/stan_math/stan/math/prim/prob.hpp:356,\n                 from stan/lib/stan_math/stan/math/prim.hpp:16,\n                 from stan/lib/stan_math/stan/math/rev.hpp:14,\n                 from stan/lib/stan_math/stan/math.hpp:19,\n                 from stan/src/stan/model/model_header.hpp:4,\n                 from C:/Users/Zane/AppData/Local/Temp/Rtmp0aU2FX/model-374c53c17b4c.hpp:2:\nstan/lib/stan_math/stan/math/prim/prob/von_mises_cdf.hpp: In function 'stan::return_type_t&lt;T_x, T_sigma, T_l&gt; stan::math::von_mises_cdf(const T_x&, const T_mu&, const T_k&)':\nstan/lib/stan_math/stan/math/prim/prob/von_mises_cdf.hpp:194: note: '-Wmisleading-indentation' is disabled from this point onwards, since column-tracking was disabled due to the size of the code/headers\n  194 |       if (cdf_n &lt; 0.0)\n      | \n\n\nstan/lib/stan_math/stan/math/prim/prob/von_mises_cdf.hpp:194: note: adding '-flarge-source-files' will allow for more column-tracking support, at the expense of compilation time and memory\n\n\n\nmod4b_data &lt;- sim_data_4b |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(x_l = sim2_parms$LoD, t = as.integer(t)) |&gt;\n    dplyr::select(t, y, x, x_l) |&gt;\n    as.list()\n\nmod4b_data &lt;- c(\n    \"N\" = nrow(sim_data_4b),\n    \"k\" = as.integer(max(mod4b_data$t)),\n    mod4b_data\n)\nstr(mod4b_data)\n\nList of 6\n $ N  : int 116\n $ k  : int 2\n $ t  : int [1:116] 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ y  : int [1:116] 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ x  : num [1:116] 1.5 3.19 1.5 3.79 4.7 ...\n $ x_l: num [1:116] 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n\npaste0(\n    \"Naruto checked the data and he says:\\n\",\n    round(mean(mod4b_data$x &lt;= mod4b_data$x_l), 4) * 100,\n    \"% of x values are below the LoD!\\nBelieve it!\"\n) |&gt; cat()\n\nNaruto checked the data and he says:\n46.55% of x values are below the LoD!\nBelieve it!\n\n\n\nfit4b &lt;- mod4b$sample(\n    mod4b_data,\n    seed = 5234521,\n    parallel_chains = 4,\n    iter_warmup = 500,\n    iter_sampling = 2500,\n    show_messages = T\n)\n\nRunning MCMC with 4 parallel chains...\n\nChain 1 Iteration:    1 / 3000 [  0%]  (Warmup) \nChain 1 Iteration:  100 / 3000 [  3%]  (Warmup) \n\n\nChain 1 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:\n\n\nChain 1 Exception: normal_lcdf: Scale parameter is 0, but must be positive!

    "section": "7.1 Data generating process",
    "text": "7.1 Data generating process\nFor this model, let’s assume that the rate of failure, \\(\\lambda_i\\) is a linear function of some covariate \\(x_i\\). I don’t know that much about machines or what would realistically cause them to fail, but we don’t want to make the example too hard at this point, so we want \\(x_i\\) to be an inherent characteristic of the machine. Let’s say \\(x_i\\) is some integer number from \\(1\\) to \\(5\\) that controls how the machine works – it is inherent to the type of machine. If I can think of a good variable that might work for this, I’ll update that later. The expected failure time increases linearly by some amount \\(\\beta\\) for each unit of increase in \\(x_i\\). There is also some baseline expected failure rate \\(\\alpha\\) shared by all of the machines. So the expected log failure time (if the failure time were constant) can be given as \\[\n\\log(\\lambda_i) = \\alpha + \\beta x_i.\n\\] We use the log link function here to ensure that expected failure times are always positive, while the function of \\(x_i\\) does not necessarily need to be.\nFinally, we assume that the longer each machine operates without being repaired, the more likely the machine is to fail. We represent this by modeling the failure time as a Weibull distribution with constant parameter \\(k\\), which influences how quickly the failure rate changes over time. We assume this parameter is the same for all machines, which are identical other than the setting \\(x_i\\).\nSo then if our failure times were completely observed, the data generating process would be as follows.\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nt^*_i &\\sim \\mathrm{Weibull}\\left(k, \\lambda_i\\right) \\\\\n\\lambda_i &= \\alpha + \\beta x_i\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nBut recall what I said before about running inspections only once a week. If this were the case, assuming our failure times are also measured in weeks, we would also have to apply a censoring mechanism for the data we observe, given by \\[t_i = \\lceil t_i^* \\rceil.\\]\nWe will deal with the interval censoring, as usual, by modifying the likelihood of the outcome. For a completely observed outcome \\(t^*_i\\), the likelihood would be \\[\n\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\theta \\mid t_i^*\\right) = f(t_i^* \\mid \\theta),\n\\] where \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is the Weibull density function. However, a censored data point actually lies at a point mass of probability and for our censored observation, the contribution to the likelihood is \\[\n\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\theta \\mid t_i\\right) = \\mathrm{Pr}\\left(\nL_i&lt; t_i \\leq U_i\n\\right) = \\int_{L_i}^{U_i}f_{T_i}(\\tau) \\ d\\tau = F_{T_i}(U_i) - F_{T_i}(L_i),\n\\] where \\(L_i = \\lfloor t_i^*\\rfloor = t_i - 1\\) and \\(U_i = \\lceil t_i^* \\rceil = t_i\\), both of which are assumed to be known constants after the data are observed.\nThe Stan code for this would be {.stan} target += log_diff_exp(     weibull_lcdf(y[i] | k, lambda[i]),     weibull_lcdf(y[i] - 1 | k, lambda[i]) ) ``` or equivalently target += log_diff_exp( weibull_lcdf(y_u[i] | k, lambda[i]), weibull_lcdf(y_l[i] | k, lambda[i]) )\nif the data is specified in the format we prefer. Note that we use the Stan\ninternal function `log_diff_exp()` for increased numerical precision rather than\ndividing the log values of the two functions manually. Note than there are[some\nconcerns](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/interval-censored-data-fails-with-weibull-but-not-gamma/28780)\nabout the numerical stability of the Weibull CDF function implemented in Stan,\nwith a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/stan-dev/math/issues/2810) for\nimproving the stability, open at time of writing. For improved numerical\nstability, we can rewrite the `weibull_lcdf()` function using Stan's newer math\nfunctions with improved stability.\n````{.stan}\nfunctions {\n  real my_weibull_lcdf(real y, real alpha, real sigma) {\n    return log1m_exp(-pow(y / sigma, alpha));\n  }\n}",

    "text": "8.1 Log-normal model\nBoth of these models will share a lot of similarities, but for some reason I find the lognormal model easier to think about, so we’ll do most of the explaining under the context of this model. We start with the assumption that our underyling, latent titer value (the “true titer”) is some real number which follows a log-normal distribution. We assume that the mean of this distribution is a linear function of the antigenic distance, as we mentioned, and we assume constant variance. In math terms, we assume that \\[\ny_i^* \\sim \\text{Log-normal}\\left(\\frac{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i}{\\log_2 e}, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\log_2 e}\\right).\n\\tag{8.1}\\] Note that we scale the coefficients by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{\\log_2{e}}\\) because \\[\\log{y_i^*} \\sim \\text{Normal}\\left( \\frac{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i}{\\log_2 e}, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\log_2 e} \\right),\\] which combined with the identity that \\[\\log{y_i^*} = \\frac{\\log_2 y_i^*}{\\log_2{e}},\\] implies \\[ \\log_2 y_i^* \\sim \\text{Normal}\\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i, \\sigma \\right) .\\] This gives us a connection to the natural units of measurement, and makes it easier to understand the models and set priors.",

    "text": "8.2 Gamma model\nThe gamma model and lognormal model are both right-skewed families which can also approximate normal distributions with the correct set of parameter values. However, the gamma family is somewhat more flexible in the ranges of shapes it can take on, and includes exponential and chi-squared distributions (as examples of shapes which are difficult to match with the log-normal distribution). Additionally, the variance of the log-normal family is independent of the mean, while the variance of the gamma family is proportional to the mean. (Another way to say that is that the coefficient of variation of the log-normal model is always constant, while the coefficient of variation of the gamma model is constant for a given value of the mean, which increases as the mean increases.)\nWhile the log of a gamma random variable does not have a simple interpretation like the log-normal family does, there are known formulas for the moments of this distribution. However, they require complex calculations using derivatives of the gamma function. Notably, there is also a generalized gamma distribution which has been proposed (CITE THIS) as a general model for fitting antibody assay data, but this distribution is not common in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGamma distribution parametrization\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least three common reparametrizations of the Gamma parametrization. Stan implements the standard “shape-scale” parametrization, which is most commonly used by statisticians. In the rethinking package, Richard McElreath implements a “mean-scale” parametrization which uses the substitution \\(\\alpha = \\mu / \\beta\\). However, in a GLM context, the most frequently used parametrization is the “shape-mean” parametrization (CITE AGRESTI AND MCCULOUGH NELDER).\nBeginning with the parametrization made in the Stan guide, we make the substitutions \\(\\alpha = k\\) and \\(\\beta = \\frac{k}{\\mu}\\). By making those substitutions in the density, we can show that \\[E(y) = \\mu \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathrm{Var}(y) = \\frac{\\mu^2}{k}.\\]\nWhen we specify \\(\\mu = f(X)\\) in the context of a linear model, we must then invert the transformation, and when we invoke the gamma distribution in Stan, we would write \\[y \\sim \\text{Gamma}\\left(k, \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\right).\\]\n\n\n\nTo specify a gamma likelihood for our titer outcome, we would write in math terms that \\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny_i^* &\\sim \\text{Gamma}\\left(k, \\frac{k}{\\mu_i}\\right) \\\\\ng(\\mu_i) &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i\n\\end{align*}\n\\tag{8.2}\\] where \\(g(\\cdot)\\) is a suitably-chosen link function. Note that the parameters of the gamma distribution must be greater than zero, necessitating the use of a non-identity link function, in contrast to the log-normal distribution where no link function is necessary. The canonical link function here is \\(g(x) = -1/x\\), which is really a pretty useless link function in a real life context because it requires us to place constraints on the \\(\\beta_i\\) values. So, use of the link function \\(g(x) = \\exp(x)\\) is more common, and is what we would use here.\nBecause the gamma distribution does not have an easily-interpretable formula on the log-scale, we fit the distribution on the natural scale of the parameter (although I guess we could also fit a gamma model to the log-scale outcome, but this is unusual) and thus we do not need to worry about the scaling of the parameters. Once again: there is no easy interpretation of the gamma regression parameters on the log-scale.\nNEED TO CITE https://www.jstor.org/stable/2685723?searchText=&searchUri=&ab_segments=&searchKey=&refreqid=fastly-default%3A7ee1f3ec4603b86f40438da20e839c33 and Moulton/Halsey",

    "text": "8.3 The observation model\nOK, so that would be great if that was all we had to do. But unfortunately, as I mentioned, HAI titers are interval censored and have a lower limit of detection, which we need to include in our model. We do this following the traditional method of updating the likelihood directly. Because of the way that the censoring mechanism occurs in practice, we need to define our censoring mechanism on the log scale. So, define \\[z_i^* = f(y_i^*) = \\log_2 \\left(\\frac{y_i^*}{5}\\right). \\tag{8.3}\\] Notably, this implies that \\[y_i^* = f^{-1}(z_i^*) = 5\\cdot 2^{z_i^*}.\\] The assay is performed by two-fold dilutions, so we actually observe the log-scale value during the measurement process. The limit of detection for the assay is conventionally 1:10, though it could be as low as 1:4 (CITE THAT THING AMANDA SENT ME). However, due to the reagents necessary to run the assay there is a physical limit of detection, and 1:10 has been adopted as a widely used standard in influenza research. For convenience, we will only consider the reciprocal titers, so a titer of 1:10 would be reported as 10. Note that \\[\nf(10) = \\log_2 2 = 1,\n\\] so 1 is the LoD on the log scale, any any values strictly less than one are below the LoD. Following standard conventions, we write these values as 5 on the natural scale, or 0 on the log scale.\nNote also that the measurement process reflects a discretization of an underyling continuous value. The HAI titer measurement is defined as the lowest possible dilution of serum which inhibits agglutination. This value could be, for example, a dilution of 12.5443 (on the natural scale), but we would observe this as a titer of 10 in our assay. Equivalently, the true latent log-scale titer might be 1.327, which we would observe as 1. See Figure Figure 8.1 for an example showing the raw lab assay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Example HAI titer data that we would observe while doing the assay in the lab. These assays are run on 96-well plates, where each row is a separate assay and each column is a serial two-fold dilution, beginning at a dilution of 1:10 (of the serum) and progressing rightwards.\n\n\n\n\n\nA convenient way to write this is by noticing that we take the floor of all values on the log scale. So, we can write our data observation model as \\[\ny_i = \\begin{cases}\n0, & y_i^* &lt; 1 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor y_i^* \\right\\rfloor, & y_i^* \\geq 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{8.4}\\]\nwhere \\(y_i^*\\) is the latent true titer and \\(y_i\\) is the observed titer.",
