# Example model #XX: Hierarchical modeling

For this example, we'll introduce the concept of hierarchical modeling, which
is extremely useful in most real world situations.

## 0 levels: fixed effects model

* $n$ students in one classroom.
* Each student has to do some task.
* We assume that there is no variation between the effect of each student,
differences in observations are due to random fluctuations from the true
parameter.
* Estimate via fixed effects model.
* Covariates

## 1 level: random effects by students

* This time we assume that each individual mean is drawn from some distribution
* What happens if we use the fixed effect model?
* random effects

## 2 levels: random effects by classes

* Adding in clusters by classrooms

## 3 levels: random effects by schools

## Bonus! 4 levels: random effects within students

* Repeated measures for each student
